# Code-First-Girls-Web-Dev-Project
Website designed and developed as part of the CFG Coding Kickstarter Course
I took part in the Code First Girls Intoduction to Web Development Course. As part of this course, I had to collaborate on a project with 3 other ladies and build a website with three linked pages which demonstrated our understanding of the html, css and basic javacript which we had learnt so far. I designed all the screen using Figma.
The website, allows the user to find events located near them , read reviews of those who previously attended , view images of the event location etc. 
Currently I would like to work on making my pages mobile responsive, introducing more javascript functionality such as error handling on my forms , eventListeners and clean up my code formatting. However as my first coding project I am quite proud and it allowed me to practise my understanding of html and css specially with flexbox and grid layouts.
